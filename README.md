# Ph1VALID-EMG

Analysis pipeline and results/reports for experiment ph1valid





## Additional resources

### raw data

EMG and Facet raw and preprocessed data is not stored in this repository, but in an [Amazon S3 bucket](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/home?bucket=ph1valid&prefix=data&region=eu-central-1) (login as described in the [main README](../README.md)). Choose 'abdd' as account/Konto, DDmitarbeiter as user name and the usual password.

You can also get the raw data from the ABDD-Server (Mitarbeiter/Christopher/O:\Mitarbeiter/Christopher/Data_ValidExp/EMG\_raw).

### Fieldtrip toolbox

The EMG pipeline works fine with any current [fieldtrip](http://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/) version. Reading the FACET data (in order to read that data as an additional 'channel') requires [this fork](https://github.com/foucl/fieldtrip) of fieldtrip. Using this fork also makes sure that the results here can be reproduced exactly.
