# Raw EMG data

Nothing to see here: As we are using the reduced/downsampled data (downsampled from ?? to 128 Hz by the BioSemi Reducer tool), this directory is not synced to save disk space and bandwidth.

You can find both the raw \*.bdf files and converted \*.CNT files in the [Amazon S3 bucket](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/home?bucket=ph1valid&prefix=data&region=eu-central-1) (login as described in the [main README](../README.md)) or on the ABDD-Server (Mitarbeiter/Christopher/O:\Mitarbeiter/Christopher/Data_ValidExp/EMG\_raw).
